# Earnings tracker with hourly income

Made this little project for my brother Seb and his friend that work and are paid hourly.   

They think it's insolent how much they get for the work they do. So for fun I made this site
that shows how much new money they made each time they visit [hit.samuel-gfeller.ch](https://hit.samuel-gfeller.ch).

After typing in the hourly income and clicking on "start" there is a timer and the earned money
that refreshes each second. When leaving focus for some time and re-opening the site, 
there is a green span that shows how much money was made in the time of absence.
